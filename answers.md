1. All of the games have the same basic idea in which you have to add cards to get a certain value. They are all single player games. They are differences for the sum, the amount of cards on the board, and the grouping of the face cards.

2. ElevensBoard extends the board class so all the variables Board carry over to ElevensBoard.

3. They do cover the differences. All the methods that work in all the games are inside the Board class. The only ones that are different are in the individual classes themselves.
