Activity 2
1. cards have three properties, rank, suit, and a pointvalue, decks are made up of cards.
2. This deck would contain 6 cards.
3. ranks will contain all the ranks for the card. suits will remain the same as well. point values will know contain a 10 for all face cards, and an 11 for ace, the rest of the cards will be normal. 
4. In terms of code it won't matter because the cards will still be made but in the terms of common sense no because all elements of the card must match.
